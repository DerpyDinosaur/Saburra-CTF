## <a id="what-is-capture-the-flag">What is a capture the flag</a>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Capture the flag (CTF) is traditionally known as an out door game played with two flags and two teams. The game is usually integrated into another game like paintball or spotlight to make it more interesting. The objective of capture the flag is in the name, capture the enemies flag and bring it to your flag to score.

<p style="text-align:justify;">A modern CTF exists that doesn't require teams but can be played with them, and plays out more like a race. A modern CTF is completely digital and requires lateral thinking to complete puzzles that reward players with flags. Flags are either a string of random characters for example an MD5 hash (a8db1d82db78ed452ba0882fb9554fc9).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
    Saburra is an entry level capture the flag that anyone can enjoy even non technical players. Saburra's name comes from Latin and it simply means sand. The challenges are set out so that you can start any where, but they come colour coded to show some level of complexity they hold. If you are unsure or lost start by trying level null. Level null is a simple practice puzzle to get yourself into the groove of things.

#### Picking a challenge

> Pick a challenge that seems the most fun or easiest to you. For example, my teacher taught me web design and I enjoy web design so I should start at "Bad web design". Don't be a sheep and start at "Steganography" just because its the first on the list.

#### Divide and conquer

> If you are playing Saburra with a team try to divide challenges up between yourselves rather than all working on the same one. This will greatly increase the speed at which you complete challenges.

#### Challenges

> Read the challenge intro, it is there to help you understand the challenge and give context. Literally try everything you possibly can in a challenge, no action or thought is too stupid. Most of the challenge answers get figured out by users but are never attempted to score.

#### Flags and Submission

> Saburra flags are a couple of words or a word acting like a password. You will know when you found one due to the word "Flag:" being before another word or words e.g. "bananasontoast". To check if your flag is correct click on the clipboard in the top right corner on any page. Type only the words after "Flag:" and they should all be lowercase except for a few exceptions. If at anytime you are confused ask one of the surrounding hosts.
